# US_Honey_Production-EDA
Explporatory data analysis on "Honey Production" data in US from the year 1998 to 2021
## Objectives of this project
- To get insights about the United States Honey Production from 1998 to 2021
- Get information about the honey production trend in United States

## Dataset
- Get the [dataset here](https://github.com/avinabagh98/US_Honey_Production-EDA/blob/66fbc4963f445d44990cb4e432af162564ebdcf8/honeyproduction%201998-2021.csv)
- The dataset is having 986 rows and 8 columns. It has size of 49.9 KB

## Background of Dataset
In 2006, global concern was raised over the rapid decline in the honeybee
population, an integral component of American honey agriculture. Large
numbers of hives were lost to Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomenon of
disappearing worker bees causing the remaining hive colony to collapse.
Speculation as to the cause of this disorder points to hive diseases and
pesticides harming the pollinators, though no overall consensus has been
reached. The U.S. used to locally produce over half the honey it consumes
per year. Now, honey mostly comes from overseas, with 350 of the 400
million pounds of honey consumed every year originating from imports. This dataset provides insight into honey production supply and demand in
America from 1998 to 2021.

## About Dataset
- **State**: Various states of the United States.
- **numcol**: : Number of honey-producing colonies. Honey producing colonies
are the maximum number of colonies from which honey was taken during
the year. It is possible to take honey from colonies that did not survive the
entire year.
- **yieldpercol**: : Honey yield per colony. Unit is pounds.
- **totalprod**: Total production (numcol x yieldpercol). Unit is pounds.
- **stocks**: : Refers to stocks held by producers. Unit is pounds.
- **priceperlb**: Refers to average price per pound based on expanded sales. The
unit is dollars.
- **prodvalue**: Value of production (totalprod x priceperlb). The unit is dollars.
- **year**: Year of production.
